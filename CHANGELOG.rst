* Created the ``CAT.workflow.key_map module`` for storing aliases
  for ``DataFrame()`` columns.
* Cleaned the modules in ``CAT.workflows``.

0.7.15
******
* Moved ``test_distribute()`` to it's own module: ``CAT.attachment.distribution_utils``.
* Added the ``brute_uniform_idx()`` for creating uniform/clustered distributions
  in a brute-force manner, *i.e.* by finding the global minimum/maximum within
  the set of all valid atom combinations.
* Generalized the ``array_combinations()`` function, it now accepts any
  array-like object and can generate combinations along any user-specified axis.
* Added the ``get_nearest_neighbors()`` function for finding the ``k``
  nearest-neighbors within a molecule.
* Added a recipe for marking a (sub-)set of surface atoms:
  ``CAT.recipes.mark_surface()``.
* Added a recipe for dissociating specific sets of surface atoms:
  ``CAT.recipes.dissociate_surface()``.
* Update to the general structure of the ``CAT.recipes`` modules.
* Multiple minor documentation adjustments.


0.7.14
******
* Changed the default value of the CP2K ``EI_SCALE14`` keyword from 0.0 to 1.0
  (*i.e.* the CHARMM forcefield default).
* Renamed the CAT ``activation_strain.scale_elstat`` keyword to ``.el_scale14``.
* Renamed the CAT ``activation_strain.scale_lj`` keyword to ``.lj_scale14``.
* Added the CAT ``activation_strain.dump_csv`` keyword for writing the raw

  Sets the value of all non-bonded potential to zero at ``activation_strain.distance_upper_bound``.
* A number of consistency improvements to the Schemas.


0.7.13
******
* Small optimization improvements to ``edge_dist()``.
* Moved a number of functions around in the CAT.utils module.
* Added the ``optional.qd.dissociate.lig_pairs`` keyword for the BDE workflow.


0.7.12
******
* Fixed a bug ``qd_opt_ff()`` where the wrong dictionary key was validated.
* Multiple updates to the CP2K MD template.
* Employ a more duck-typing based approach during the ``schema`` validation.
* Fixed a bug in the ``jobs`` module where incorrect ``Results()`` instances
  were returned.
* Multiple documentation updates.


0.7.11
******
* Updated the ``CAT.attachment.qd_opt_ff`` module in preparation for
  https://github.com/nlesc-nano/nano-CAT/pull/26.


0.7.10
******
* The function for applying distance weights during the
  subset-generation process is now configurable.
* The default distance weighting function has been changed to
  ``weight = "np.exp(-x)"``.
  The old p-norm with ``p=-2`` is still accessible via: ``weight = "x**-2"``


0.7.9
*****
* Added the option to interpolate between ``"uniform"`` / ``"cluster"`` and
  ``"random"``.
* The order of the ``p``-norm is now configurable.
* The variable representing the anchor-atom subset size has been changed
  from ``p`` to ``f``.
  ``p`` is now reserved for the order of the ``p-norm``.
* https://github.com/nlesc-nano/CAT/pull/70: Fixed an issue with the
  ``_parse_cluster_size()`` index offset.


0.7.8
*****
* It is now possible to create ``"uniform"`` distributions of clusters,
  the size of each cluster being user-specified.


0.7.7
*****
* The ``"uniform"`` and ``"cluster"`` distributions are now weighted by
  the distance rather than using a, less robust, distance truncation.


0.7.6
*****
* Added the option, when constructing core atom subsets,
  the use a distance matrix representing the shortest paths along the
  edges of a polyhedron, rather than through space.
  Enabling this option will result in more accurate ``"uniform"`` and
  ``"cluster"`` distributions at the cost of increased computational time.
* Updated and improved the ``"uniform"`` and ``"cluster"`` distributions.
* https://github.com/nlesc-nano/CAT/pull/65: Fixed a bug where ``uniform_idx()`` yielded the rolled,
  rather than unshifted, indices.
* https://github.com/nlesc-nano/CAT/pull/64: Bug fix: the subset Schema now checks for instances of
  int ``Or`` float.
* https://github.com/nlesc-nano/CAT/pull/66: Return the identity (rotation) matrix if a ``FloatingPointError`` is
  encountered during the creation of rotation matrices.
  This can occur if a ligand consists of a single atom.
* https://github.com/nlesc-nano/CAT/pull/66: Fixed a bug in the parsing of the mode parameter of ``distribute_idx()``;
  ``"uniform"`` and ``"cluster"`` will now correctly link to ``np.argmax`` and
  ``np.argmin`` instead of the other way around.


0.7.5
*****
* Added the ability to populate only a (random-ish) subset of
  core anchors with ligands.


0.7.4
*****
* The ligand rotation check is now substantially faster:
  a distance cutoff has been implemented for the construction
  of distance matrices.


0.7.3
*****
* Added an option perform an ensemble-averaged QD activation strain
  analyses in Nano-CAT_.
* Removed a number of redundant modules.
* QD optimization now properly respect the ``optional.qd.opt.use_ff`` keyword.


0.7.2

* Fixed a couple of bugs in the ligand dissociation workflow.
* Reworked the ligand dissociation procedure in Nano-CAT_.
